# LingoEngine

**LingoEngine** is a C# runtime for games originally written in Macromedia Director's Lingo language. It provides a modern, modular architecture so existing Lingo projects can run on top of different rendering frameworks.

## Projects

| Folder | Description |
|-------|------------|
| `src/LingoEngine` | Core Lingo runtime and abstractions |
| `src/LingoEngine.LGodot` | Adapter for the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) engine |
| `src/LingoEngine.SDL2` | Adapter for SDL2 based applications |
| `src/Director` | Experimental Director API reâ€‘implementations |
| `Demo/TetriGrounds` | Sample game showing how to integrate with Godot and SDL2 |

See the [Architecture overview](docs/Architecture.md) for details on how these pieces fit together.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open `LingoEngine.sln` in your preferred C# IDE. To build a demo project, choose the corresponding solution inside `Demo/TetriGrounds`.

Detailed setup instructions are available for:

- [Godot](docs/GodotSetup.md)
- [SDL2](docs/SDLSetup.md)

## Running Tests

This repository uses the **.NET SDK**. Make sure `dotnet` is available in your
`PATH` before running the test suite:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Refer to the [official installation guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/) if the `dotnet` command is missing.

You can automatically install the SDK by executing the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/install-dotnet.sh
```
