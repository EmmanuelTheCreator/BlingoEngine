# AbstUI.SDL2RmlUi

Backend for the AbstUI framework that augments the SDL2 implementation with input support powered by [RmlUi.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RmlUi.NET).

This project provides richer keyboard and mouse handling compared to the plain SDL2 backend and adds basic RmlUi-powered button and text input components.
