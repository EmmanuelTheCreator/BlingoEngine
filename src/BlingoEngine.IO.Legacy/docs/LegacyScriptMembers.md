# Legacy Script Cast Members

[← Back to the format overview](./README.md)

Director stores script-specific metadata inside the `CASt` info block that
precedes every compiled `Lscr` resource. The modern Director 6–8 exports used by
our fixtures follow a predictable layout that allows the loader to grab the
script number, the embedded source, and the behaviour name without scanning.

## `CASt` info block structure

The info payload begins immediately after the `memberType`, `infoLength`, and
`specificLength` words in the `CASt` chunk. Offsets below are measured from the
start of the info payload. Director 4 and later include a pointer table that
positions the embedded script text at byte `0x006A`. A small subset of
truncated archives omit the pointer data, so the loader falls back to the
length-adjacent offset at `0x0021`. The reader chooses between these layouts by
inspecting the archive's **Director file version** stored in the `imap` control
block.

| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x0000` | 4 | Reserved fields that remain zero in observed files. |
| `0x0010` | 4 | **Script number** stored as a big-endian signed integer. The
value links the member to the `Lscr` entry listed in the `Lctx/LctX`
script-context tables. |
| `0x001D` | 4 | **Script text length** stored as a little-endian unsigned word.
Lengths of zero mark compiled-only entries. |
| `0x0068` | 2 | Pointer table slot that precedes the behaviour text (Director 4+). The loader skips the two-byte pointer and begins reading at `0x006A`. |
| `0x006A` | `length` | Lingo source text encoded as single-byte characters (Director 4+). |
| `0x006A + length` | 1 | Length of the script name. Zero indicates that the name is omitted. |
| `0x006B + length` | `nameLength` | Script/behaviour name in single-byte encoding. |

Older exports that strip the pointer table expose the script text immediately
after the length word at `0x0021`. Unknown Director versions are left untouched
until we document their layout.

## Script categories

The `CASt` specific data stores a selector word whose low byte identifies the
script category. Director 4 through 10 exports emit the selector as a
big-endian 16-bit value, while some Director 3 archives pad the selector to a
32-bit word with zeros in the high-order bytes. The loader accepts either byte
ordering and trims the padding so truncated files keep resolving to the same
code.

| Code | Category | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x01` | Behaviour (score) script | Attached to sprites on the score timeline. |
| `0x03` | Movie script | Listens for global playback events. |
| `0x07` | Parent script | Defines prototypes that factory instances reuse. |

## Compatibility notes

* Compiled-only behaviours report a zero text length. The reader keeps the
format information but leaves the `Text` and `Name` properties unset.
* Director 4/5 style casts only provide the script selector in the specific
block. When the pointer table is missing, the reader falls back to the
length-adjacent offsets after confirming the byte count fits.
* Director 3 exports omit the pointer table entirely. Use the
  `LegacyTextAfterLength` layout in `BlLegacyScriptWriter` when emitting
  synthetic fixtures for those archives.
